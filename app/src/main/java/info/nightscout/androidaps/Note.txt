*Note by ls2n edition file*

This directory contains the main architecture of the Android APS application.

The main file where every module is connected is in the "MainApp.java"

Then, every aspect of the application has to be coded as a Plugin, contianed in the "plugins" directory.

The "plugins/source" was edited with some new entry added in order to simulate more simply our command with the Android APS's virtual pump. 
As a result a sinus oscillation entry was added (between 70 and 180 mg/dL) as well as a small oscillation around the target.
An other entry was added which enables the user to chose a constant value for the glycemia and he can change it whenever he wants (manual entry).

In the "plugins/aps" directory, plugins corresponding to the new algorithms (Dynamic Bolus Calculator and PID). They invoke the files in the "assets" with 
the algorithms source codes.
