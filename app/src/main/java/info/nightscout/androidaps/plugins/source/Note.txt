*Note by ls2n edition file*

This "plugin/source" directory contains all the sources for blood glucose (BG) reading. We have added :

-ConstantPlugin, gives a constant step value of BG
-ManualPlugin, same but allows to change manually the value of the constant at any time
-RandomBG2 , a sinus variation between 2 given values (originally 70 and 190)
-RandomBG3, a certain variation of the BG values
-Small Oscillation, sinus around the target value


***Not complete***
-SourceVirtualPatientPlugin.java : the objective is to simulate the behaviour of a patient using an initial conditions and then let the equations calculates the BG
